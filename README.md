## DON'T FORGET TO RESET THE CONFIGURATION FILE WHEN UPDATING THE MOD

# Description
A Minecraft 1.7.10 mod to optimize by fixing bugs, and changing things on the backend of the game.

# Incompatibilities
The original ArchaicFix doesn't work with my mod due to MixinMapGenStructure on it, use my fork instead: [ArchaicFixFork](https://github.com/quentin452/ArchaicFix).
